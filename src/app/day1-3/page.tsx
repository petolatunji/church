              It is wọnderful to get to 2024 breakthrough time. God has been
              wọnderful to our lives. It is not by power or by might but the
              grace of God has preserved us. We are still breathing and this
              gives us hope and opportunity to do a lot of things. Today we
              gather to say ‘thank you Jesus’. God desires our appreciation of
              his benevolence. His care and supply have sustained us. The truth
              of life is that, even some who seem to have served God better than
              we do has not enjoyed enough of what the Lord’s mercy has thrown
              at us.{" "}
              <p>
                Our heart must always be full of gratitude to the almighty God.
                If you are a man who is simply focused on your needs, you will
                never be good at showing appreciation. If you don’t learn to
                praise God in all situation, you will never learn to smile let
                alone laugh. Ingrates will always groan in complaints. It is
                time to say thank you to our Redeemer.

              Life is in stages and with seasons and times and appropriately
              manifesting as ordained by God. There is always times and seasons
              to plant, time to wait and lastly time to harvest to crown all
              efforts. Likewise, for someone who wants a child, the pregnancy
              period then the birth of the Child. Labor time is not always an
              ease time. At times its with weeping, serious sweating but at last
              what will bring laughter is to successfully see and handle what
              you’ve labored on/for; then you forget the labor period for the
              enjoyment of your harvest. I pray for you, you shall never labor
              in vain. It is always painful not to get a positive result of your
              labor, it’s a fruitless effort, wastage of energy resources etc.

              As you lift up your voice today to God, He will bring you laughter
              at the end of the meeting – over your work (job), children,
              ministry, business, marriage etc.

              If Abraham don’t have, do you think he will be able to invite
              people over to his house to come eat? Not really. God is not
              unwilling to bless his children most often we are the one who
              attracts lack to ourselves. There are principles of heaven to
              having resources in abundance Luke 6:38 <span className="quote">Give, and it shall be
              given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together,
              and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the
              same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you
              again. (KJV) </span>very many of us have always confessed negatively when
              matters of giving is raised; we often say we don’t have.

              Some don’t pay tithe, they find excuses like ‘its not in the New
              Testament’ forgetting that by the teachings of the New Testament,
              10% is the least of what God demands from us. Some don’t give to
              support other men or to God’s work; others think that they will
              get resources by their personal hustling minus God’s blessing,
              they have forgotten that it is God’s blessing that make one rich
              without sorrow. Pro 10:22. How did Abraham get rich? He was
              obedient Gen 12 He was never greedy, remember how he settled land
              dispute with Lot He was a generous giver He paid Tithe Heb 7:2 He
              was a hard worker He was a prayer warrior Gen 18 There is nothing
              he cannot offer to God as sacrifice Gen 22 He is spiritually
              sensitive. He identified people he should give treat Can we
              improve on our obedience in order to get out of the circle of lack
              and want?
