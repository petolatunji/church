          <p className="btext">Text: Ezekiel 40:42; Acts 10:38-40</p>
          <div className="text-justify mt-4">
            <p>
              Today, some believers are sick because they went into fornication.
              Since nobody except God and their sin partner were aware, they
              secretly continued in the sin. Before long, they exchanged divine
              health for ill-health. When you take the forbidden fruit of sin
              you become a piece of bread before you enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              All acts of sin bring trouble. Sin and sickness are closely linked
              in the bible, (Matt 9:2; James 5:15). The Jews believes that sin
              is a major cause of ill health. Confession of sin is therefore
              very important. Note that confession of sin frees a man’s mind and
              bring relief and comfort. If you are in the situation, pray and
              ask for God’s mercy and the Lord will save you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sin devours everyone who indulges in it, but if you are keeping
              yourself pure as Joseph did then the Lord will be with you Gen
              39:1-9.

                establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of

              Genesis 1:2 painted a picture of a chaotic world. The world was
              with no order and full of darkness, it was fit to be inhabited by
              any good thing to a level that even the spirit of God had no where
              He could rest in that waste land. God saw the disorderliness and
              found out that it is not good; He sprang to work immediately and
              started creating beauty into it. He started by putting light into
              that world and causes boundary line between light and darkness.
              After this, God created other beautiful things until it was clear
              that the world was a beautiful place that is fit for man to live
              in.

              Some people’s lives are still in the darkness state. There life’s
              is full of darkness and empty of good things and God has no place
              in their life’s because they don’t have Jesus the light of the
              world in their life’s. The only way is Jesus (John 14:6).
