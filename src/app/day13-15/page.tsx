            Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
            down from the Father of lights,.... As God is giving good gifts to
            His children, Satan is also distributing his to the disobedient
            ones. Some have received gift of sickness, sorrow, diseases, curse
            etc. like Gahazi and his family. But while men slept, his enemy came
            and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.{" "}

            Which unwanted gift have you received either knowingly or
            unknowingly through covetousness, lust, wicked act or selfish life
            living? The healer, deliverer is here. If you can repent and call on
            Him, He will cancel all these bad gifts and send shower of blessings
            on you. Pray earnestly now and you will see the result.

            Joseph was a man of great destiny. Solution for a generation.
            Despite that, there were challenges on his ways but he waited on God
            until his time came. The mother of Jabez called him Jabez (son of
            sorrow). But God said I know the thought I think towards you, a
            thought of good and not evil, and to take you to an expected end.
            When are you expecting your time of laughter? God said call on Me
            and I will answer you. I will show you great and mighty things you
            have not seen. Will you keep quiet looking or call on Him as He said
            and receive answers to your requests? Wake up and pray now.

            Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
            Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a
            strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. Let nothing make
            you afraid if the Lord is on your side. If God be for us who can be
            against us? Rom. 8:31. Hear what the Lord said "Wherefore say unto
            the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from
            under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their
            bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with
            great judgments: and I will take you to me for a people, and I will
            be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God,
            which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
            Just do your own part by praying in holiness and righteousness and
