            <span className="btext">Isaiah 45:1</span> Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose
            right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
            loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates;
            and the gates shall not be shut.

            Anointing on a man's head symbolizes God's presence, approval,
            backing, empowerment etc. Head on the other hand is an important
            factor that represents the destiny of a man. Yoruba adage says ‘by
            the head you choose meat from the plate’. When you submit an
            important document and it require your photograph to be attached, it
            must be a passport which will shows your head where your face is
            located that is required. The state of your head determines either
            you are living good or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            When anointing is spiritually poured upon a man’s head, it is a
            divine endorsement which in turn brings divine backing on whatever
            the person will be doing. The anointing is the ever-presence of the
            Holy Spirit in the life of a man. A man not anointed is therefore
            weak and will be unable to accomplish. Cyrus was anointed for the
            rebuilding of Jerusalem (the book of Ezra), the anointing herald
            victory and provision. Your life must carry God’s anointing. Psalms
            23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
            enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

            Exploit is made easy when God is in it. Laughter become the order of
            the day because victory comes in succession. Absence of God in a
            matter is an invitation to crisis. The two sons of Eli the priest,
            Hophni and Phinehas, sent for the ark of God symbolizing the
            presence of God to fight the Philistines. They assumed the presence
            of God of Israel for the empty ark. Their troop were joyous when the
            ark got to their midst, even the enemies knew that with God on their
            side victory is sure. But instead of victory, shame, death, loss,
            and weeping was the end result (1 Samuel 4:1-22). To be victorious
            and possess your possession this year you must value, seek and
            ensure the presence of God in your life.

            You must put your trust in the Lord to be able to make Him number
            one in your life and follow Him. The success of the forty years
            journey in the wilderness was all because God was going before them
            as a pillar of Cloud in the day and Pillar of Fire by night. He
            never left them a single moment. God want to be around us always but
            we must also live a life that will encourage His presence.

            Record shows us that from Genesis, there had been famine from time
            to time and these days are not different. God has provisions for his
            people at all time, he provided for Abraham during the famine of his
            time, he provided for Isaac during the famine of his generation.

            Readers, it is very important to focus on God who has power to do
            impossibilities, since the government can't help all of us at a time
            like this. I want you to remember that the promise of God for us
            this year stands sure that we will laugh no matter the condition.
            What you need to do is just to trust him, and follow his
            instructions per term. The warning word is that never look at men
            for solution rather, keep your fellowship with God warm and strong.
            I am blessed with laughter
