          <p>
            The book of Jeremiah pictures the heart of man to be desperately
            wicked and further explain that you can't know it. You can't know
            the deep thought of the wicked, their faces can be smooth and
            smiling but inside of such are venom of a cobra.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The wicked need no mercy of God neither that of men. if Cain can
            kill his own blood brother, if Absalom can be after the life of his
            own father, if Ammon didn't care what will be the end of Tarma
            destiny, if Hamman was ready to destroy a whole country just because
            he claimed one man offended him; which was not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is that they are everywhere, at home, at workplace and
            bad enough in church. the bible says among my people are wicked
            ones. We need to cry for the help of God to help us destroy the
            wicked ones because they are always around us. and they are not
            ready to change.

            Have you been robbed of anything? Have you lost anything? Before
            your lost thing can be restored back there must be some things and
            steps that are needed for it to be restored.

            The glory of God is an endowment of God upon any man that makes his
            life great and this is always a problem to the devil. Devil is
            always looking for ways to see that man did not succeed in the
            fulfilling of his glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is need to have this understanding that living without glory
            is living without the future, we are in the battle front here on
            earth and our greatest enemies are the devil and the flesh. You have
            to strive for your glory and seek for God's help. I pray that you
            will manifest in glory in Jesus name (Amen).

            Our God is the God of yesterday, today and forevermore, He change
            not. The God who worked in diverse ways in the lives of men of faith
            who we can refer to as our fathers of faith is still at work today
          </p>
          <p>
            It is expedient for you to know how He works i.e. He is the God of
            Abraham – He shew himself to Abraham as <b>Jehovah Jireh</b> (God
            our provider). Also, as the God who makes and keeps covenant.
          </p>
          <p>
            To Jacob in Laban’s house, He is a Mediator in Gen 31:29, Laban told
            Jacob that “The God of your father has told me, be careful not to
            say anything……..”. That is the God we serve.

            Elisha also knew the God who worked in the life of his father
            (Elijah) and called out to Him at a crossed road, and God surely
            manifested by parting the river for him to pass.
