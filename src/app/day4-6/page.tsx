            <p>
              To be ashamed mean that something ignoble has befallen a person.
              It means we are in a situation that is not commendable or
              glorious. Failure and defeat bring shame. It is a defeatist
              feeling whereby we will not be able to raise our head in the
              community of men.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are engaged in the battle of life and the enemy of our soul is
              set to put us to shame. It is the plan of the enemy to disgrace
              us. They want events in our lives to bring shame to the name of
              our God. They are working hard to make us to fail and lose in the
              battle of life. We must pray today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sin also bring shame because it makes the presence of the lord to
              depart and set up the enemy to attack us. When the Israelites lost
              the battle at AI, they were disgraced and all these happened
              because Achan took of the accursed things in Jericho. We must
              watch how we live our lives so that we will not allow the enemy to
              rejoice over us. Trust in the Lord because “Those who trust only
              in the lord cannot be ashamed.” Ps 34:5.

              When God made promises, all of them are not designed to come to
              pass immediately. Some missed their blessings because they left
              the point of waiting before the appointed time. There is a
              possibility that not 100% of the believers were at the upper room
              on the day of Pentecost. Some with excuses would be somewhere else
              when the holy spirit suddenly came unannounced. It was only the
              believers who were in the upper room that got filled.

              Many these days are distracted by personal philosophies,
              arrogance, quest for money or are simply in haste and can’t wait
              for the lord. You need the grace to wait in hope so that you will
              no longer be missing your time of harvest. A farmer must wait
              until what he plants is ripe for harvest before he harvests hence
              he will waste his labour. Some today have gone the wrong
              directions, become a cheat or even do ritual to get money; they
              failed to wait. Impatient destroyed Saul the king of Israel. This
              impatient is born out of disbelieve that God will come at the
              appropriate time. Waiting on God is very profitable and necessary
              because; God cannot fail and his timing is different from ours.

          <h1 className="mainTit">Breaking from bad habit</h1>
          <div className="text-justify mt-4">
            <p>
              Habits are routine behaviors or actions that are regularly
              repeated and often performed automatically. these behaviors become
              ingrained through repetition, creating a pattern that the brain
              associates with a particular cue or trigger. Habits can be good or
              bad, positive or negative. Today we are praying God to break us
              from bad habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bad habit is that attitude you have developed that you are no
              longer conscious you have them because they have become part of
              your life. There are some of them you will even condemn when you
              see it in other people, yet they are in your life. <span className="btext italic">Pr 12:15 The
              way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth
              unto counsel is wise.</span> Unfortunately, we don’t always know what bad
              habits we manifest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bad habit sometimes makes people to avoid us in certain situations
              or can make us to lose favour. Sometimes, not many people around
              us will correct us except those very close to us because we are
              likely to argue or deny it. The attitude can be in your manner of
              speech, facial expression, sound making or even manner of eating
              or drinking, movement of certain part of the body, sleep pattern,
              gossiping, distracting manner, shouting etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are sometimes through self-awareness, we identified some of
              those bad habits, but we are finding it hard to stop it. To laugh
              this year, anything that will make you to be unattractive should
              be dealt with. The Holy Spirt can deliver us from bad habit if we
              are determined to improve on ourselves. You must desire to be a
              better person every day; don’t say it’s not important.
