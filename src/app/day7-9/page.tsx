              Your situation can change. Our God is a specialist in giving a man
              a tỌtal turn around. To really laugh, we need a turn around. The
              Bible is full of stories and testimonies of turn arounds.

              Saul was really persecuting the Church and the name of Christ. He
              was seriously incensed against the church; but as he was on a
              journey to Samaria, the Lord encountered him and he surrendered to
              the Lord. He became a minister of the same Christ he had been
              persecuting. He began a new spiritual journey that made him a
              friend of God. This is a major turn around and key to our
              relationship with God.

              Hannah was barren and she had prayed ceaselessly but nothing
              happened. Then on another occasion at Shiloh, she prayed and God
              answered her and she gave birth not only to Samuel but to other
              children as well. What God will begin when he gives you a
              turnaround shall be unstoppable.

              What can I say about the turn around of Sarah, of Jabez and of
              Obed Edom. What a sudden turn around that Job witnessed after his
              trial or what will you say about Joseph who left the prison to
              become a ruler. You must earnestly asked God to turn you from ZERO
              to HERO. NOTHING to SOMETHING, POVERTY to RICHES.

              We should be here today to renew ourselves to God. Anyone who
              belong to this fold enjoy an amazing covenant relationship with
              God. We therefore all enjoy the covenant promises to be blessed
              and be happy people who worship the Lord.

              As Samuel invite the Israelites to come to Gilgal that the Kingdom
              might be renewed there, so also we have come today to renew
              Revival Centre unto the Lord. 1Sa 11:14 Then said Samuel to the
              people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom
              there. As individuals too, let us renew ourselves to the Lord on
              this day.

            <p>
              Ps 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were
              like them that dream. 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
              and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The
              LORD hath done great things for them. 3 The LORD hath done great
              things for us; whereof we are glad. (KJV) Zion here refers to the
              people of Israel but typifies the Christians. They were taken
              captives by their enemies as a result of their sins. Whenever God
              is angry, he releases the enemy to discipline his people. The
              enemy now take them captive and enslave them. But God will not
              forever be angry with his people. Captivity can be restored.
              Captivity restoration is when God liberate his people from their
              captors and bring them back to their land of inheritance and
              return to them all that their enemies have taken from them. 1Sam
              30. No deliverance is beyond God.
              <p>
                Some miracles can be like a dream, looking as if it is not real.
                When God does something unexpected in our lives, it always looks
                as life ‘can this be for real?’. This will bring laughter.
                Laughter is somewhat spontaneous and short. But it is a sign of
                pleasant thing happening around us. Sometimes we are weighed
                down by unpleasant events around our lives. We struggle shrug
                off some and we find it difficult. With the strength and help of
                God around us, we are more than conqueror.
